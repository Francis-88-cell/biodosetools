#### Data format

The only requirement for the data is to be in `.csv` (or `.txt`) format and two have the following structure:

- The columns should include headers.
- The remaining columns should contain the cell distributions of dicentrics `CX`, where `X` can `0, 1, 2, 3...`.

An example of how the data should be formatted can be seen below.

```
C0 ,C1,C2,C3,C4,C5
104,72,15,2 ,0 ,0
```

The rest of columns will be calculated automatically:

- `N` is the total number of cells.
- `X` is the number of aberrations.
- `y` is the observed yield, and `y_std` is its standard error.
- `DI` is the dispersion index $Ïƒ^{2}/y$.
- `u` is the $u$-value, which for a Poisson distribution should be unity.
