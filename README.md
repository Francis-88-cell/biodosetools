## Overview

This project in an app to be used by biological dosimetry laboratories.
Biodose Tools is an open-source project that aims to be a tool to
perform all different tests and calculations needed. The app is
developed with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a>
together with <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com">Shiny</a> to offer an
on-line, easy-to-use solution. Although the intention is to provide the
application as a website, all R routines can be downloaded for
improvement or personal use.

We also aim to clarify and explain the tests used and to propose those
considered most appropriate. Each laboratory in its routine work should
choose the optimum method, but the project aims to reach a consensus
that will help us in case of mutual assistance or intercomparisons.

The project is initially developed by
<a href="http://www.reneb.net">RENEB</a> association, but contributions
are always welcome.
